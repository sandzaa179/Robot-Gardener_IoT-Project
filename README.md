# Robot-Gardener_IoT-Project
   My name is Sorawit Choknahee,a Grade 12 student at Manchasuksa School, Manchakiri District, Khonkean, Thailand.
This is the first IoT project born out of self-education. This project is called Robot Gardener, which has been studied on the <a href="https://mooc.chula.ac.th/">Chula Mooc website</a> and modified By switching from Raspberry Pi to esp32 devkit v1 to reduce costs suitable for student status.
   The Robot Gardener is built to be innovative for the environment. and created to study IoT the details of the following. 

## Detail
  Use soil moisture sensor and LDR light sensor to collect data and send it to firebase Firebase real-time database. The obtained value will map the min value to the max value at 0 and 100 to set the value as a percentage.
### Connection
<li>Soil Moisture Sensor (3.3V)[Connect to Pin G34]</li>
<li>LDR Light Sensor (3.3V)[Connect to Pin G35] </li>
<li>Relay for Pump (5V)[Connect to Pin G23]</li>
<li>Relay for LED (5V)[Connect to Pin G22]</li>

### Setting
send information to a deadline What time does it start? and stop at what time and set the percentage that is lower to turn on pump or LED (developing a blyke to show and send data) now used as a setting value in Firebase.

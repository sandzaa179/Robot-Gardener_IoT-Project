# Robot-Gardener_IoT-Project
   My name is Sorawit Choknahee,a Grade 12 student at Manchasuksa School, Manchakiri District, Khonkean, Thailand.
This is the first IoT project born out of self-education. This project is called Robot Gardener, which has been studied on the <a href="https://mooc.chula.ac.th/">Chula Mooc website</a> and modified By switching from Raspberry Pi to esp32 devkit v1 to reduce costs suitable for student status.
   The Robot Gardener is built to be innovative for the environment. and created to study IoT the details of the following.
